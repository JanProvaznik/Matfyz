1 It's really wonderful to think that we are living in the current age instead of any other.
2 It always surprises me when there is a flood.
3 It's a pity that there is no sea in Czechia.
4 It's no use worrying about the uninfluencable.
5 It cannot be denied that the Earth is round.
6 It appears to me that most people are not rational.
7 I always apperciate it when it's sunny.
8 I hate it when I don't understand a lecture.


ESP
EGB = AGH they are vertically opposite angles
EGB = CHF they are alternate angles
EGB = GHD they are corresponding angles
EGB + AGE = 180 they are adjacent angles on a straight line
EGB + BGH = 180 they are interior angles on the same side of the transverse line
